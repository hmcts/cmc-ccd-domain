## Contents

* CMC CCD model
* CMC CCD JSON Definition (*note:* [definition/README.md](./definition/README.md) for how to handle definitions)
* Tooling to release/manage CCD Definition
* ToDo:
    * Exercise cmc-claim-store and cmc-claim-submit-api functional tests (and any other consumers)

## Release

Version number is defined in file [VERSION.yaml](./VERSION.yaml), both artefacts use same version number.

On any tagged commit Travis and Azure DevOps will release both artefacts. 

- Travis will build and push to bintray: http://dl.bintray.com/hmcts/hmcts-maven/uk/gov/hmcts/reform/cmc/ccd-domain/
- Azure DevOps will build and push to ACR: hmctspublic.azurecr.io/cmc/ccd-definition-importer

Both status's are refelected on README with build badges.

*NOTE:* Docker images are write and delete protected to stop overwriting tags. If you do need to delete an image then you will need to disable these flags, e.g.: `az acr repository update --name hmctspublic --image cmc/ccd-definition-importer:1.2.2 --delete-enabled true  --write-enabled true` 

#### To release:

Manually release through GitHub: https://github.com/hmcts/cmc-ccd-domain/releases

### Definitions

Definitions have a separate release process for promotion to PROD. See definition [README.md](./definition/README.md#)

## Development (WIP)

1. Open PR here, bumping up /definitions/VERSION.yaml to 1.2.1 (no functional test running at this stage)
    * cmc-ccd-domain - master 1.2.0
    * cmc-claim-store - master 1.2.0
    * cmc-integration-tests - master 1.2.0
1. Merge PR
    * cmc-ccd-domain - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-claim-store - master 1.2.0
    * cmc-integration-tests - master 1.2.0
1. Open PR in cmc-claim-store and cmc-integration-tests, pinning version to new CCD definition 1.2.1 (this runs functional tests ensuring backward compatibility with current code base)
    * cmc-ccd-domain - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-claim-store - master 1.2.0
    * cmc-integration-tests - master 1.2.0
1. Merge PR in cmc-claim-store and cmc-integration-tests after green build (that brings the newer definition to all local dev environments)
    * cmc-ccd-domain - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-claim-store - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-integration-tests - master 1.2.1
1. Generate CCD Definition from the Docker image 1.2.1, attach to new Jira ticket, manually deploy to DEMO and AAT. 
1. Manually regression test CCD Definition 1.2.1 in AAT.
1. Manually deploy CCD Definition 1.2.1 to PROD.
1. Open code change PR in cmc-claim-store (that run all functional test again new code and version 1.2.1)
    * cmc-ccd-domain - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-claim-store - master 1.2.1
    * cmc-integration-tests - master 1.2.1
1. Merge code change in cmc-claim-store after green build (deployed into PROD)
